Developed a mental health and well-being application focused on supporting users in managing stress, emotional health, and daily mental wellness. The application provides a safe and user-friendly platform where users can track their mood, reflect on their emotions, and access guided tools designed to promote self-awareness and emotional balance.

The system enables users to log daily mental states, identify patterns over time, and receive personalized insights based on their inputs. By combining structured data tracking with intuitive visualizations, the application helps users better understand emotional trends and potential stress triggers. Emphasis was placed on privacy, simplicity, and accessibility to ensure a comfortable and trustworthy user experience.

This project demonstrates the practical application of software development in the mental health domain, highlighting skills in full-stack development, data handling, and user-centric design. The solution aims to encourage proactive mental wellness, reduce stigma around mental health, and provide users with a supportive digital companion for everyday emotional care.
